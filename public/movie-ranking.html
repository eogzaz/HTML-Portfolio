<h1>The Best Movie Acoording to Emiliano</h1>

<h2>My 3 movies favorites</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>I love how it raises a debate between science and faith,
using something as striking as aliens.</p>

<h3>The godfather</h3>
<p>It's great how it explores the concept of loyalty through the mafia.</p>

<h3>Inglourious Basterds</h3>
<p>A film that shows war from a very unrealistic perspective, but,
satisfying and visually fascinating.</p>
